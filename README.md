# Introduction to [Simulatory](https://simulatory.vercel.app)

## Mission

Simulatory - the name comes from combining both ***Simula**tion* and *Labora**tory*** - provides both simple and highly customizable simulations for creative tinkerers. These simulations try to provide practical, yet simple representations of otherwise complex topics (e.g. *[Conway's Game of Life](https://simulatory.vercel.app/game-of-life)*, representing over- and underpopulation) by utilizing basic rulesets and simple mathematical formulas.

In this way, not only the basics of math, but also more sophisticated areas such as statistics and probabilitied are conveyed in an interactive manner. The user can leverage the build-in modification settings, thereby experiencing manipulations of differend variables first-hand.

## Contribution

You can contribute by adding presets, modifications, or improvements. Ideas and recommendations are also highly appreciated. **Feel free to share whatever you think might contribute.**

- Topic: over- and underpopulation
- Description: Simulate and modify the legendary zero-player game of life, carefully devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
- Modifications: The rules (circumstances under which cells are populated and depopulated) can be modified individually.
- Presets: Basic presets include the **glider**, the **glider gun**, **the reactor**, and many more. Also, by merging multiple presets, combinations such as the **glider collider** or the **space race** have been crafted.

*New simulations underway...*
